Title: Fine-Tuning LLaMA 3 with Unsloth: A Lightweight, Fast, and Efficient LLM Project

Introduction
In this project, I fine-tuned a powerful language model using Unsloth, a high-performance library optimized for 4-bit model training and inference. The model I used was LLaMA 3 8B in 4-bit quantized format, enabling efficient fine-tuning even on limited hardware. I trained it on the Alpaca-cleaned dataset to build a responsive and instruction-following model.

1. Installation & Setup
We began by installing Unsloth and related performance-enhancing libraries like Flash Attention and xFormers, depending on GPU compatibility. These tools drastically reduce memory usage and speed up training.

2. Loading the Model
Using FastLanguageModel.from_pretrained, I loaded a 4-bit quantized version of LLaMA 3. The model was set to handle sequences up to 2048 tokens long. Tokenizer was also loaded to handle text processing.

3. Applying LoRA (PEFT)
To enable efficient fine-tuning, I applied LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) using Unsloth's get_peft_model. This method trains only a small number of adapter layers instead of the full model, reducing compute and memory requirements significantly.

4. Dataset Preparation
I loaded the "yahma/alpaca-cleaned" dataset, a widely used instruction-following dataset. I formatted the data using a consistent prompt template:

Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
{instruction}

### Input:
{input}

### Response:
{output}<|end_of_text|>

This format guides the model during training and ensures it understands task-specific queries.

5. Training Configuration
Using SFTTrainer from TRL, I configured training to run for 60 steps (customized for my testing needs). I used a batch size of 2, gradient accumulation, AdamW 8-bit optimizer, warmup steps, and mixed precision (FP16 or BF16 depending on GPU support). Training was done efficiently using only the LoRA adapters.

6. Inference & Evaluation
Post-training, I switched the model to inference mode using FastLanguageModel.for_inference. I generated responses for custom inputs like converting binary to decimal and listing prime numbers, confirming the model had learned the format and tasks.

7. Export Options
The fine-tuned model can be exported in various formats:

16-bit or 4-bit merged weights (for general deployment)

LoRA-only weights (lightweight adapter files)

GGUF formats (for llama.cpp or Ollama)

Applications
This fine-tuned LLM can be used to:

Build custom chatbots

Answer domain-specific questions

Serve as a backend for AI assistants

Be deployed via APIs or desktop apps

Conclusion
By using Unsloth and LoRA, I demonstrated how to fine-tune a powerful LLM on a limited budget. The result is a compact, efficient model capable of instruction-following tasks. This approach is ideal for developers, researchers, and startups looking to personalize LLMs without heavy infrastructure.

Try It
You can deploy the model on Hugging Face, serve it locally using FastAPI, or run it with tools like llama.cpp. The entire pipeline is lightweight, cost-effective, and production-ready.
